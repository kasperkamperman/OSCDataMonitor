# OSC (Open Sound Control) Data Monitor

Monitor incoming OSC data on your network with this little program. A quick way to check if you have communication with OSC sending equipment in your network. See [kasperkamperman.com/blog/osc-datamonitor/](https://www.kasperkamperman.com/blog/osc-datamonitor/) for a video walkthrough.

This repo contains the source code for Processing 4. You have to install the used libraries yourself in order to run it (OscP5, ControlP5).

You can get the Windows and (signed) MacOS applications [here on Lemonsqueezy](https://kasperkamperman.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout/buy/03e29103-797b-4eb7-9f7c-231094426cf7) (price $7.99). 

If you are on Linux or another OS I recommend you to use Processing and build the application yourself if you need.

Thanks to [Andreas Schlegel (sojamo)](http://sojamo.com) for the excellent [OscP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscp5/) and [ControlP5](https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5) libraries on which this program heavily relies.

This monitor was originally developed for a [databending workshop](https://code.google.com/archive/p/osc-tools/).
